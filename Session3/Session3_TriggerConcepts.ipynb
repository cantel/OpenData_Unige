    "## Trigger Conceps\n",
    "\n",
    "Most particle physics experiments will use a trigger during data acquisition as opposed to streaming out the data continuously. A trigger is a signal that tells the data aquisition system to read out the detector data corresponding to an instance in time (an event) for storage. The latency of a trigger decision is dictated by the buffer size of the system: A trigger decision cannot take longer than the time you can afford to temporarily store the detector data for consecutive events of interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does ATLAS need a trigger\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment at the proton-proton interaction point is extremely busy: We have up to 60 proton interactions per bunch crossings, and 30 million bunch crossings per second!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/3e/cd/07/3ecd07951c28fd36eee321274c82310a.jpg\" width=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "ATLAS needs a way to be _highly selective_ of the events of interest to keep: Without a trigger system we would need to find a way to record > 40 TB of data per second! \n",
    "\n",
    "### What does the trigger select?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Highly selective\" often simply means a requirement of an event to contain reconstructed particles with transverse momentum or energy, $p_T$ or $E_T$, above a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** This is because the $p_T$/$E_T$ distribution of background particles is exponentially falling:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img img align=\"center\"  src=\"https://inspirehep.net/files/7e472b6518d7e64ddb95a6bc7d8fc7db\" width=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning:\n",
    "- Energetic events (in transverse plane) are more interesting because of the lower background rate.\n",
    "- The $p_T$ threshold is an easy way to controlling trigger rates with intensifying LHC conditions.\n",
    "    \n",
    " > **It does not mean there is no interesting physics below threshold! It is just much more challenging to look there.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beside a requirement on the minimum $p_T$, a trigger selection can also require:\n",
    "- A certain multiplicity of objects, e.g. 4 hadronic jets with $p_T$ > 100 GeV.\n",
    "- Additional requirements on particle characteristic, e.g. minimum of 2 hadronic jets that have an 85% probability of being initiated by a bottom quark (\"b-tagging\").\n",
    "- And even requirements on the event topology, e.g. a requirement of two jets with a high combined invariant mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, we have 100s of trigger selections that run parallel, deciding separately what events to keep. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The impact of triggers on physics analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Beside irrevocably determing which events are stored for an analysis, the decision also impacts the sensitivity of your analysis.\n",
    "The latter is not only because it will dictate the energy threshold of leading particles in your events for analysis! As already stated, the triggers are required to make a decision within a certain amount of time. This gives them limited amount of time to reconstruct particles to base the decisions on, meaning we will not reconstruct particles as precisely online as we would in stored data. In addition, refinements such as calibration constants and detector alignments can be done later on on offline stored data, which may again deteriote the online reconstruction performance with respect to offline reconstruction performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are therefore two important concepts related to trigger and your physics analysis:\n",
    "* *Important Trigger Concept 1*: Because of our highly selective trigger, our dataset is heavily biased. When analysing data, the very first step is to choose the trigger that is most appropriate for your physics analysis (the one that has the largest acceptance for your signal) and then filter the data based on whether that trigger fired.\n",
    "* *Important Trigger Concept 2*: Your selection of physics events will depend on the trigger selection _and_ selection efficiency when the data was taken: Electrons reconstructed more precisely offline may not have had the same measured $p_T$ online, nor have even been correctly identified as an electron.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring trigger efficiencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually measure the trigger efficiency via \"**trigger efficiency turn-on curves**\". Turn-on curves simply measure the number of events kept by the trigger/total number of events$^*$ for events containing your signal, as a function of one of the variables used in the trigger selection, usually the $p_T$ of the reconstructed particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's first get to grips with the concept of trigger turn-ons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$^*$_By the way, you may ask how do we know the total number of events if they were not triggered by our chosen trigger? What are your ideas?_\n",
