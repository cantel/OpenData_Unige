While ATLAS has a suite of inclusive triggers, for example a trigger for events containing at least one electron/positron above 24 GeV or at least one hadronic jet above 400 GeV, there is also room for more specialised triggers that looks for events that look like a specific Standard Model or hypothetical new process. \n",
